DCIT 318: PROGAMMING II ASSIGNMENT 2
• Creating a C# console application.
• Create three applications to demonstrate different aspects of object-oriented
programming in C#:
Inheritance and Method Overriding
- Define a base class called Animal with a method MakeSound() that prints
"Some generic sound".
- Create a derived class Dog that overrides the MakeSound() method to print
"Bark".
- Create another derived class Cat that overrides the MakeSound() method to print
"Meow".
- In the Main method, create instances of Animal, Dog, and Cat, and call the
MakeSound() method on each instance.
Abstract Classes and Methods
- Define an abstract class called Shape with an abstract method GetArea().
- Create a derived class Circle that implements GetArea() to calculate the area of a
circle.
- Create another derived class Rectangle that implements GetArea() to calculate the
area of a rectangle.
- In the Main method, create instances of Circle and Rectangle, and display their
areas.
Interfaces
- Define an interface called IMovable with a method Move().
- Create a class Car that implements IMovable and prints "Car is moving" when
Move() is called.
- Create a class Bicycle that implements IMovable and prints "Bicycle is moving"
when Move() is called.
- In the Main method, create instances of Car and Bicycle, and call the Move()
method on each instance.
Instructions:
- Create a repository named dcit318-assignment2-ID
- Clone it to your local machine and console application.
- Commit each task separately.
Submission:
- Submit a compressed folder of your repository to Sakai.
